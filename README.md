# Poke3D
This is a AR Pokemon application built on Swift using ARkit2. The concept of the application is bringing interaction and
in a sense some life to your old pokemon cards. Poke3D takes advantage of Apples' new ARkit2 platform, currently there
are only 12 recognized cards but will be adding more cards and models.

## Current Cards with 3D models

* Bulbasaur
* Charizard
* Charmander
* Cyndaquil
* Eevee
* Entei
* Espurr
* Machop
* Oddish
* Pikachu
* Squirtle
* Torchic
```
